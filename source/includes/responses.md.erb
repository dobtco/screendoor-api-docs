# Responses

## List a project's responses

Returns a list of responses to a specified project. Note that in order to retrieve the `assignees` or `archived_responses` keys in the returned data, you'll need to use the [single response endpoint](#retrieve-a-single-response).

```shell
curl "https://screendoor.dobt.co/api/projects/2/responses?v=0&api_key=d9763djh1274"

# Example Response
[
<%= partial 'resources/response.json' %>]
```

### HTTP Request

`GET /projects/:project_id/responses`

### Query Parameters

| Parameter | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| sort | `"id"` | One of `"id"`, `"submitted_at"`, `"responses_updated_at"`, `"status"`, `"has_signature"`, `"num_ratings"`, `"responder"`, `"responder_email"`, `"assigned"`, `"average_rating"`, `"edit_status"`  |
| direction | `"asc"` | Either `"asc"` or `"desc"` |
| trash | `false` | Set this to `true` to view responses that are in the trash. |

In addition to the parameters above, this endpoint accepts the same query parameters as Screendoor's [responses page](http://help.dobt.co/articles/screendoor/responses/viewing_a_list_of_responses.html).

To find the correct parameters, consider using [advanced search](http://help.dobt.co/articles/screendoor/responses/searching_for_responses.html#using-simple-and-advanced-search) to construct a query. Then copy the `?advanced_search=` part of the resulting URL.

(Since API keys aren't associated with individual users, you will not be able to use query parameters that refer to "my rating.")

## Create a response

## Spec for the response hash

In order to encode a response to a Screendoor form, you must use the format defined below. In each key-value pair, the key is the ID of your response field, and the value depends on the type of that field. (You can find the ID of a response field in Screendoor's form builder, at the bottom of the "Edit field" pane.) See [an example](#update-a-response) of a complete payload above.

| Field type | Format |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Text | `"foo"` |
| Paragraph | `"I have many skills, but the most important ones are my abilities to collect information from people, screen it effectively, select the right options, and follow through with the right options quickly."` |
| Checkboxes | `{ "0": "on", "1": false }` <br><br>or with "other" selected:<br><br> `{ "0": false, "1": "on", "other_checkbox": "on", "other": "Something else" }` |
| Multiple Choice | `"Choice #1"` |
| Dropdown | `"Choice #2"` |
| Date | `{ "month": "2", "day": "15", "year": "2015"}` |
| Time | `{ "am_pm": "PM", "hours": "6", "minutes": "01", "seconds": "30"}` |
| Phone | `"4151234567"` |
| Email | `"foo@bar.com"` |
| Address | `{ "country": "US", "street": "123 Main St.", "city": "Pleasantville", "state": "Illinois" }` |
| Table | `{ "0": ["col 1 row 1", "col 1 row 2"], "1": ["col 2 row 1", "col 2 row 2"] }` |
| Numeric | `"123.45"` |
| Website | `"http://www.google.com"` |
| Price | `{ "dollars": "12", "cents": "99" }` |
| File | `"b42Unp-Oj_qeyCWNDaTBXr8nygNq5x4-"`<br><br>To get this ID, first upload a file using the endpoint described [below](#uploading-files). |
| Map Marker | `{ "lat": "40.7700118", "lng": "-73.9800453" }` |

## Uploading files

In order to include a file in the [response fields hash](#spec-for-the-response-hash), you must first upload it using the following endpoint.

```shell
curl "https://screendoor.dobt.co/api/form_renderer/file?v=0&response_field_id=123" \
  -X POST \
  -F "file=@/path/to/file"

# Example Response
