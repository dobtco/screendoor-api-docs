# Response assignments (deprecated)

*Note: Access to the response assignment API is only available in version 0.*

A response can be assigned to many teams and/or users. An "assignment parameter" takes the format of `:type,:id`, where type is either `ProjectTeam` or `User`, and `id` is the identifier for that record.

For example, to reference User #9, we would use the parameter `User,9`.

## List a responses' assignments
